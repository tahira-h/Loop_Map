# Loop_Map

## Instructions:

1) Write a program that does the following:

* Asks the user for 5 numbers
* Stores them in an array list
* Finds the sum, product, largest, and smallest of those numbers


2) You are a car dealer. Create a hash map of vehicles.

* The model is the Key, the make is the Value.

* (Ask the customer what car (model) they are looking for. Use the Hash Map to determine if you have that vehicle, and what make it is.
-(e.g. "Oh, you're looking for a Civic? Our Honda selection is right over here...")
